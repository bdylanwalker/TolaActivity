"""
This script uses GitHub APIs to fetch a list of issues associated with a project.
It outputs issue numbers and titles for all cards in all columns of the project.
The output is particularly useful for putting into the GitHub release notes.

This script is completely unrelated to the Tola Activity application and should be run as
a standalone python script.
